# Abstract

This paper introduces a framework combining several kinds of multiscale decomposition methods into one process.

### What is Image Fusion

1. To fuse different image caught from different sensors during a same period of time.

2. To fuse image from a same sensor during different period of time.

### Why do we Fuse Image

1.  To get a image which works better than any of its original image.

### How do We Fuse Image

1. One kind of fusion method is pixel-level multisensor fusion, which means focusing on the image pixel by pixel.

The aim of LPT is to save the information lost in gauss pyramid

Gauss pyramid contains the original picture and its down-sampling picture, witch seems like a pyramid.
